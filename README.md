# STM32 Device Drivers

A repository dedicated to various device drivers for the STM32 microcontrollers.

They were developed with the help of the stm32f3xx_hal library for the STM32F303RE microcontroller. However, they should work with any STM32 after adjusting the HAL library to use in a driver's header file.

Any suggestions or fixes are gladly appreciated.

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/reaper47/stm32-device-libraries/wiki) for the library's documentation.
